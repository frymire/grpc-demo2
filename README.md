My refactored version of the route guide demo from the gRPC tutorial.

If you import into Eclipse and compile with Maven, Eclipse will likely show errors even if the build succeeded. This is because Eclipse hasn't recognized the sources generated by Google Protocol Buffers, even though the folders where they live are explicitly listed as source folders. Refreshing the project (F5) should fix the problem.
